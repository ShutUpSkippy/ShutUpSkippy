Hey, Iâ€™m @ShutUpSkippy (+1 if you get the book ref). I like programming in general, but most of all love to create programs that make your life easier. 
I mostly develop with .NET and C#, but I occasionally dabble with other frameworks/languages.
If you have an idea for an awesome program lemme know, and I'll see what I can do. (just don't make it too big pls)

So yeah. Guess that's that.
